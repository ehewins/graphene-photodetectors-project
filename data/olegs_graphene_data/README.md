# Comparitive Data from Other Graphene Devices

These data files were given to us by our project supervisor, and contain data from the resistance vs gate voltage measurements of four different graphene samples. The idea is to compare the properties of these graphene samples to our own samples.

## About the Files

`Bad_CVD_T300K.dat` corresponds to bad quality CVD graphene on Si/SiO2 (T = 300 K)

`Exf_4K.dat` corresponds to exfoliated graphene sandwiched between hexagonal boron nitride layers (T = 4.2 K)

`Good_CVD_T300K.dat` corresponds to good quality CVD graphene on Si/SiO2 (T = 300 K)

`iGR_300K.dat` corresponds to 3D printed graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (T = 300 K)

In all of these files, the first column is the volgate (Volts) an the second column is the resistance (Ohms).
