This repository contains the data, data processing, and modelling for Ellis Hewins and Jack Bourne's 2024 Physics MSc project.
Project supervisor: Dr. Oleg Makarovsky (associate professor at the School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham).

# About the Project

The project centres around graphene-based photodetectors, functionalised using either quantum dots or perovskite nanocrystals to achieve photoconductive gain via a photogating effect. 

The `data` folder contains electrical measurements for several different samples (grouped into subfolders), as well as Python scripts used to graph the results and perform data analysis.
Information about each sample can be found in the README files of each subfolder.

The `model` folder contains scripts which computationally model condution in the graphene transistors. More details to follow in future revisions of this file.
